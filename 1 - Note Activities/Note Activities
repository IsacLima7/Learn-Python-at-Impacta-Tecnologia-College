'''Maria, in addition to being a trader, is also an excellent trader!
That's why she always gets discounts on her purchases. when visiting a
store, Maria received the following proposal from a salesperson: "If you buy
my merchandise will grant a fixed discount of 10% and an additional 1% for each
unit purchased". Unfortunately, Maria is tired of working so hard
and she doesn't want to do the calculations herself to find out what the value will be
of the purchase before and after the discount, so she asked for your help.

You will create a program that will receive as inputs a real number,
indicating the price of the merchandise purchased by Maria, and an integer,
indicating the quantity of purchased goods, and will display the purchase value
before the discount and the final amount, with the discount already applied.

Note: For all intents and purposes, assume that this store never sells more than
than 40 units of the same commodity for the same person. Notice that not
it is necessary to verify, just assume that this is true.'''

'''"There's no way!", Julius repeats to himself that big city traffic is the
biggest villain of his days, causing him to spend a lot of time on the way
between his house and his first job, between his first job and his second
job. , and between your second job until homecoming. Well, Julius has two jobs!

Julius is great at accounting, but because he's always in a hurry, he's never
had time to calculate the total time spent in traffic, from the moment he
leaves the house to the moment he returns. Your watch is old, not making it
possible to time one course, pause and continue timing on the next one, so it
only knows the time spent between individual courses, not the time spent on
the courses added together. Julius was even offered a new watch at a discount,
to which he replied to the seller that "not buying the watch would give a
bigger discount".

You, as a good friend, have volunteered to create a program that takes as
input the times of Julius's three journeys (home to first job, first job to
second, and second to home) and displays the total time consumed.

Do not forget that the three times will be given in minutes.'''

'''Megan wants to buy a brand new smartphone and is very excited about the
possibilities that such an inch screen can offer for her entertainment. But
there's a problem, Megan realized that she doesn't know how to deal with
inches, after all she always performed calculations using centimeters and
would like to use that unit of measurement to imagine the screen size she
will buy. Can you help Megan?

Her job is to build a program that takes as input a real number, symbolizing
a quantity of inches, and displays the equivalent in centimeters. Remember
that one inch is equal to 2.54 cm.'''

'''You like games? Silvio likes it! Even more mathematical games that need
logical reasoning. As Silvio is very creative, he created a game to spend
time with his friends between class breaks. The game is simple, one of
his friends says out loud a natural number greater than or equal to two
and Silvio must quickly say the odd number before and the even number
after the pronounced number.

You're a programmer who likes challenges, after all, every programmer
faces challenges all the time, and that's why you offered to create a
program to automate Silvio's answer, taking as input a natural number
greater than or equal to two and displaying the previous odd and the
rear pair.'''

'''How good it is to be enrolled in a course related to computing!
There are many interesting subjects and a world of discoveries! However,
as with almost everything in life, to be successful, commitment and effort
are needed to learn the contents that are passed on by teachers, as they
require extra-class attention and study.

You, an exemplary student, earn high grades and that's why you don't
worry about the final average in the subjects, because you know you will
pass without needing a substitute exam. However, some of his colleagues are
apprehensive, as they were used to studying "at the last minute" and took
a while to realize that this "tactic" no longer works. Therefore, they want
to know if with the grades they have they will pass, fail or if there is a
possibility of approval with the substitute test.

Since in critical situations there is also compassion, you decided to
create a program to help your colleagues. Your program will receive as
input two real numbers, the first representing the grade of papers and
the second the grade of the regular exam. Considering that each of the
two grades represents 50% of the final average, your program will display
a message indicating the student's situation, which can be one of three:

a) Passed: if the final average is greater than or equal to six;

b) Perhaps with the substitutive test: if there is any possible
grade in the substitutive test that allows the final average to
be greater than or equal to six. Remembering that, as well as the
grade of papers and regular exam, the maximum grade in the substitute
exam is ten and that it can only substitute the grade of the regular exam,
not the one of works;

c) Failed: if the final average is less than six and there is no possibility
of recovery, even with the maximum grade in the substitute test.

Note: The name of the problem is a reference to the classic phrase uttered
at the end of the semester by students who do not study properly.'''

'''Modern times"… and we are not referring to the classic film by Charles
Chaplin, but to the facilities that technology provides, unimaginable a few
decades ago. One such technology is the internet, which has made online shopping possible.

We can buy on company websites and in a few days the merchandise will be in our hands.
Impacta Express, an e-commerce multinational with its own distribution logistics,
wants to revolutionize making any delivery within six days of making the purchase.

By participating in programming sites such as URI Online Judge, the IT coordinator
of Impacta Express found you among the first in the rank, was fascinated by your
performance and invited you for an interview!

As part of the interview, the coordinator requested a program that receives as input
two values: (I) a string with a day of the week ('Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday',
'Thursday', 'Friday' ' or 'Saturday'), without accents, which indicates the day a customer
made a purchase on the company's website; (II) a natural number that can vary from 0 to 6,
which indicates the number of days, from the date of purchase, that the customer must wait
to receive the goods. The program must display the day of the week that the purchase will be delivered.

Note that a lead time of zero days means delivery will be completed on the same day,
and a lead time of two days means delivery will be completed exactly two days after
the purchase is made. For example, if the purchase was made on 'Saturday' and the
deadline is three days, the customer will receive it on 'Tuesday'. Be careful with
the accent, notice that it is not present in the entries or in the exits, not even the 'ç' of third.'''
